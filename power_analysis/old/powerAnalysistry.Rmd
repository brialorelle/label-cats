## Extract effect sizes from meta-analysis for conditions and age ranges of interest

```{r}
meta=as.tibble(read.csv('Label advantage in concept learning.csv')) 

effectSizes_All<- meta %>%
  filter(audio_condition %in% c("noun","silence", "non-linguistic sound")) %>%
  group_by(audio_condition) %>%
  summarize(meanEffect = mean(g_calc), sdEffect = sd(d_calc))%>%
  data.frame

effectSizes_Targeted<- meta %>%
  filter(audio_condition %in% c("noun","silence", "non-linguistic sound")) %>%
  mutate(mean_age_months > 12) %>%
  filter(response_mode=="eye-tracking") %>%
  group_by(audio_condition) %>%
  summarize(meanEffect = mean(g_calc), sdEffect = sd(d_calc))
```
To gain clarity on this complex literature, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis of this literature, including `r length(meta$study_ID)` conditions from `r length(unique(meta$study_ID))` papers and `r sum(meta$n)` infants, finding an overall effect size of Hedgesâ€™ g = `r round(mean(meta$g_calc),2)`. These effect sizes differed considerably based on the auditory stimuli that infant's heard: nouns elicited consistency greater novelty preferences than non-linguistic tones (noun, Hedges' g M = `r round(effectSizes_All$meanEffect[2],2)`, SD = `r round(effectSizes_All$sdEffect[2],2)`; tones, Hedges' g M = `r round(effectSizes_All$meanEffect[1],2)`, SD = `r round(effectSizes_All$sdEffect[1],2)`); however, categories learned during silent conditions also generated novelty preferences (silence, Hedges' g M = `r round(effectSizes_All$meanEffect[3],2)`, SD = `r round(effectSizes_All$sdEffect[3],2)`.
