1. Where to run installation command
2. What is the format of the credentials file (.txt)
3. Qualifications -- maybe helpful to read these in from a text file somehow instead of entering them in by hand? Seems typo prone.
4. http://uniqueturker.com/ -- broken link? Maybe is https://uniqueturker.myleott.com/ Could this not be integrated somehow?
5. nosub create doesn't do anything? need error message or link to help instead of blank screen
6. Can't get credentials to work (what is this format that we need)
